# A AsyncConstructable is a class with a async (class-)method `construct` that is used when
# asynchronous constuction/instantiation logic is needed (which cannot be handeled in
# a synchronous __init__ method).
# With the current typing features of Python, it seems not possible to correctly type
# a class with that signature.
# E.g. one could define a typing.Protocol subclass with following method:
# ```
# class AsyncConstructable(Protocol):
#     @classmethod
#     async def construct(cls, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any): ...
# ```
# However, this is incompatible with implementations that don't explicitly use `*args`
# and `*kwargs`, e.g. the following method does not comply with the above function stub:
# ```
# class SomeImplementation(AsyncConstructable):
#     @classmethod
#     async def construct(cls, foo: str): ...
# ```
# Thus using a type alias for now:
AsyncConstructable = Any


# A AsyncContextConstructable is a class with a (class-)method `construct` that creates an async
# context manager for safely setting up and tearing down an instance of that class.
# With the current typing features of Python, it seems not possible to correctly type
# a class with that signature.
# E.g. one could define a typing.Protocol subclass with following method:
# ```
# class AsyncContextConstructable(Protocol):
#     @classmethod
#     @asynccontextmanager
#     async def construct(cls, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any): ...
# ```
# However, this is incompatible with implementations that don't explicitly use `*args`
# and `*kwargs`, e.g. the following method does not comply with the above function stub:
# ```
# class SomeImplementation:
#     @classmethod
#     @asynccontextmanager
#    async def construct(cls, foo: str): ...
