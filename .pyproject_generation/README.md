# Generating the pyproject.toml

The pyproject.toml of the service is generated by combining static configuration
captured in [`./pyproject_template.toml`](./pyproject_template.toml) and custom
package metadata specified in [`./pyproject_custom.toml`](./pyproject_custom.toml).

The `./pyproject_template.toml` is managed by the template, please do not edit manually.

You may specify properties in the `./pyproject_custom.toml` which are already specified
in the `./pyproject_template.toml`. In that case, the `./pyproject_custom.toml` takes
priority.
